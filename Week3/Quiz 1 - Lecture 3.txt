1. 6 steps of data science workflow:

    1. Define the goal
    2. Collect & Manage DAta
    3. Build the Model
    4. Evaluate & Critique Model
    5. Present Results & Document
    6. Deploy Model

2. What is unsupervised learning? 
   
    It is a type of machin learning when class lables of the data are unknown.

3. How do you avoid over-fitting your data?

    Basically, it is whe a model has zero training errors and significant test errors.

4. Name 3 machine learning algorithms 

   Classification, Regression Trees, Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbors
  
5. Name 3 components of a time series
