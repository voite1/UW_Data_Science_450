1.What is the difference between correlation and causation? 

  A correlation between variables does not mean that the change in one variable is the 
  cause of the change in the other variable. Causation is when one event is the direct
  result of the occurrence of the other event.

2.What is more important – feature engineering or learning algorithms? Explain.
  
  Feature engineering is more important than learning algorithms because
  feature engineering transforms the data into a set of worable features that represent
  a problem. As a result feature engineering improves model accuracy on the yet to
  be discovered data relationships.

  Learning algorithims is simply memorizing how to apply algorithms to a particluar
  set of problems. While learning algorithms is good, simple knowledge of the 
  algorhithms cannot catch or utilize opportunities feature engineering can provide.

3.Which is better – a simple model or a complex one? Explain. 

  Simple model is generally better than a complex one. Basically, Complex model may introduce 
  bias and also can lead to overfitting.

4.What is the meaning of a stationary time series? 
  
  Statistically speaking, stationary time series have constat mean,  constan variance, and 
  constant autocorrelation. Basically, the data in a stationary time seriese is hihgly 
  predictible.
  

5.What 3 time series methods are captured by ARIMA?

  CSS - Conditional sum of squares
  CSS-ML - minimize conditional sum ofsquares to find starting values. Then maximum 
    likelihood ( default)
  ML - Maximul likelihood
